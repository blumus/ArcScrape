```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Docker Compose
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd ArcScrape
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code Dev Container:**
   - Open the project in VS Code
   - When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   - VS Code will automatically build and start the development environment

3. **Manual Docker setup (alternative):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Services

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Port:** 8000
- **Framework:** FastAPI with Uvicorn
- **Database:** MongoDB integration via PyMongo
- **Development:** Hot reload enabled

### MongoDB
- **Port:** 27017
- **Image:** Official MongoDB latest
- **Data persistence:** Enabled via Docker volumes

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string (default: `mongodb://mongodb:27017/cloudculate`)

## Development

### Running the Application

Once the dev container is running:

```bash
# The FastAPI server should start automatically
# If not, run manually:
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Access the application:
- **API:** http://localhost:8000
- **Interactive API docs:** http://localhost:8000/docs
- **MongoDB:** localhost:27017

### Installed Development Tools

The dev container includes:
- Python 3.13
- FastAPI and Uvicorn
- MongoDB Python driver (PyMongo)
- VS Code extensions for Python development
- Code formatting and linting tools

### Adding Dependencies

Add new Python packages to [`backend/requirements.txt`](backend/requirements.txt) and rebuild the container:

```bash
# If using dev container, rebuild:
# Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"

# Or manually:
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

## Database

MongoDB is configured with persistent storage. Data will persist between container restarts via the `mongo_data` volume.

## VS Code Extensions

The dev container automatically installs:
- Python support and IntelliSense
- Docker integration
- GitHub Copilot
- Code formatting (Black, Flake8)
- Type checking (MyPy)

## Troubleshooting

### Container Issues
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs dev_env
docker-compose logs mongodb

# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Clean rebuild
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```

### MongoDB Connection
```bash
# Test MongoDB connection from within the dev container
mongosh mongodb://mongodb:27017/cloudculate
```

## Contributing

1. Make changes in the mounted volume (`/app` in container = `./backend` on host)
2. Changes are automatically synced and the server reloads
3. Test your changes using the FastAPI docs at http://localhost:8000/docs

## AWS Credentials Setup ðŸ”‘
This project requires AWS credentials to interact with cloud services.

### Why Read-Only?
For security, we strongly recommend using read-only access. This follows the Principle of Least Privilege, limiting the application's permissions to only what's necessary to read data.

### Configuration
Provide AWS credentials (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Region) for a read-only IAM user. Configure these via:

Environment Variables: (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION)

Never hardcode credentials.
